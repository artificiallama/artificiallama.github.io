I am a postdoctoral researcher based in Toronto.  My research work is in the field of Monte-Carlo based optimal estimation.
My expertise is in Monte Carlo based Kalman filtering to estimate state and parameters. I assimilate satellite data and insitu observations of atmospheric and chemical variables into numerical models of fluid flow (which provide the first guess). I hold a Bachelors and Masters degrees in Physics from India.
 
<br/> 
<br/> 
In Machine learning I am interested in  Natural Language Processing, image processing and optimization related problems.
